# Dog-Breed-Classifier-App

A Python application implemented in Flask, using Keras and Tensorflow, to recognise the breed of any uploaded dog image.

The application makes use of pre-trained keras models by importing the selected model during initialisation. The model used in this example is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network, trained using transfer learning on an existing Xception imagenet model.
